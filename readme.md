# Simple Todo Page

We now have all the basic tools of the front end at our disposal. Let's put them to work. It's quite common to build a To Do List application when you're starting out, so let's do that, too. 

## Requirements:

* One page site with our list on it. We will be using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) tomorrow so you can jump ahead if you'd like but other than that, I would just style it using basic CSS
* A user can create an item on their list using a prompt or something else of your choosing. The items are saved in `localStorage`.
* A user can mark an item done and the text has a ~~strikethrough~~ on it.
* A user can delete an item.
